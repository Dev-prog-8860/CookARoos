### Project Description
Chicken Translator is a lighthearted web application that takes human speech or text input and "translates" it into fun, randomized chicken sounds like cluck, bawk, chirp, and coo. Using speech recognition or typed input, the app mimics what it might sound like if chickens could talk back in their own language. The translation is not literal but playful, aiming to entertain rather than interpret.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever wondered what chickens might be upto? You never know if they're planning to localize wheat farm or world domination

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The answer is simple just translate thier language... right?
